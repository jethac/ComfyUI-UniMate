"""Transformer blocks and layers the denoiser variants are built from.

* :mod:`.common` — pieces every variant shares (norms, SwiGLU FFN, adaLN
  ``modulate``, timestep embedder, input/final layers, tpos pool) plus the
  full-attention blocks ``DiTBlock`` / ``DiTCrossBlock``.
* :mod:`.graph` — factored spatial (graph-biased, per-frame) + temporal
  (per-joint) attention and the ``SpatioTemporalBlock`` around them.
* :mod:`.cross` — text cross-attention, and the factored block that adds a
  cross stage.

Everything in ``common`` is re-exported here, so
``from unimate_pack._vendor.denoiser import blocks`` is enough for the shared
pieces; the two attention families are imported from their own modules.
